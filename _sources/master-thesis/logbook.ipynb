    "* Investigate how to use ipywidgets to toggle between different $m$ and $n$ for bilayer lattice\n",
    "* Rename files for clarity\n",
    "* Figure out how to wrap function for small screen viewing (or maybe scroll bar like for tables)\n",
    "* Write introduction file and update site image\n",
    "* Make lattice drawing class more variable\n",
    "* Include reciprocal vectors in k_path image\n",
    "* Resolve reference conflicts\n",
    "* Include horizontal lines in band structure\n",
    "* Choose theme for plotly plots\n",
    "* Write explanations for code when refactoring is done"
