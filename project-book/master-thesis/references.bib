	abstract = {A moir{\'e} pattern is formed when two copies of a periodic pattern are overlaid with a relative twist. We address the electronic structure of a twisted two-layer graphene system, showing that in its continuum Dirac model the moir{\'e} pattern periodicity leads to moir{\'e} Bloch bands. The two layers become more strongly coupled and the Dirac velocity crosses zero several times as the twist angle is reduced. For a discrete set of magic angles the velocity vanishes, the lowest moir{\'e} band flattens, and the Dirac-point density-of-states and the counterflow conductivity are strongly enhanced.},
