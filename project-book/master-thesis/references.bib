	abstract = {A moir{\'e} pattern is formed when two copies of a periodic pattern are overlaid with a relative twist. We address the electronic structure of a twisted two-layer graphene system, showing that in its continuum Dirac model the moir{\'e} pattern periodicity leads to moir{\'e} Bloch bands. The two layers become more strongly coupled and the Dirac velocity crosses zero several times as the twist angle is reduced. For a discrete set of magic angles the velocity vanishes, the lowest moir{\'e} band flattens, and the Dirac-point density-of-states and the counterflow conductivity are strongly enhanced.},

abstract = {We discuss the generation of a library of projector augmented-wave (PAW) and ultrasoft pseudopotentials (PPs) for all elements of the periodic table from H to Pu. The PPs are compared with two libraries: pslibrary.0.3.1 and the GBRV library (Garrity et al., 2013). The PPs are tested on the lattice constants of the fcc and bcc structures of the 63 elements of the GBRV library. The same parameters are used to generate fully relativistic PPs that are compared with the scalar relativistic PPs. The PPs of lanthanides and actinides are tested on all-electron data available in the literature.}
