# Twisted bilayer WSe_2

In October last year \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12147.pdf}{Wang et al} published an experimental paper on the magic continuum in twisted bilayer tungsten-diselinide (tWSe$_2$) {cite}'tWSe2_experiment'. Here they found flat bands similar to the ones found in twisted bilayer graphene but at a larger twist angle of approximately 5 degrees. At low temperatures varying the electron density gives rise to insulating and superconducting states. Due to the large twist angle we aim to build a tight binding (TB) Hamiltonian for tWSe$_2$ without having to resort to a continuum model \cite{continuum_model}.
