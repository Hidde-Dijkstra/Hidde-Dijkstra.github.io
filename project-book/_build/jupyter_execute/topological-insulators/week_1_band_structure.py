# Bloch Theorem and Tight-Binding Model

We study the behavior of electrons in periodic lattices of atoms. Every atom is identical and as such we have translational invariance for any $\mathbf T=\sum n_i\mathbf a_i$, where the $a_i$ are the lattice vectors of the lattice. We model the lattice with a periodic potential $V(\mathbf r)$ that obeys the translational symmetry: $V(\mathbf r)=V(\mathbf r+\mathbf T)$. Now the stationary Schr√∂dinger equation describes the behavior of an electron in this potential:
```{math}
H=-\frac{1}{2m}\nabla_{\mathbf r}^2+V(\mathbf r),
```
here, and in the future, we take $\hbar =1$.
